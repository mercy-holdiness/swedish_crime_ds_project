Define the business case:
Purpose: To survey the crime statistics in Sweden for the past from years and uncover any possible trends with respect to overall increase/decrease in crime, and distributions in gender and age in the data collected.

I was motivated by a security company where I learned that they are interested in delivering crime statistics to individuals to help inform them on safety and on options for security, and for businesses/corporations to help them to set liability and security indices for insurance adjustments etc. given the implemented security procedures that they offer.

With a broad overview of the crime statistics in Sweden, it might be interesting to see trends and to show where one can further develop questions on how to gain insights through data which exists or which is missing.

The official figures in Sweden do not reflect the reality particularly well either. Autopsies are performed on almost 90 % of drivers who die in road accidents, during which samples of body fluids are taken and then sent for analysis to the National Board of Forensic Medicine. When the data on fatal accidents is correlated with the results of the analyses, the finding is that 19 % of Swedish drivers who died in accidents in 1999 had alcohol in their bodies. The official statistics for that year put the figure at 5,6 %! The reality, therefore, is three times the figure given in the official statistics. We must also understand that not even that 19 % is a true reflection of reality since some of those casualties survived the accident for a time, during which any alcohol may have dissipated.
One reason for the faulty statistics in Sweden is that the official accident figures are based on police accident reports. The possible influence of alcohol as a factor in the accident is based on police suspicion that there was. In an accident, the police's main task is to prevent injury to anyone else and priority is therefore given to the other traffic, which means that they very frequently fail to test the driver's alcohol level.

On 17January 2001, the (EU) Commission adopted a recommendation (1) on the maximum permitted blood alcohol content for drivers, inviting the Member States to apply a general limit for blood alcohol level lower than or equal to 0,5 milligrammes per millilitre (mg/ml) and to step up the checks made by the police forces.

Further information on changes in Blood alcohol content regulations in Sweden around 1994
The most recent changes in the Swedish legislation on driving whilst under the influence of alcohol entered into force on 1 February 1994. Therewith, the limit for the blood alcohol content (BAC) was reduced from 1.5 per mill to 1.0 per mill (i.e. from 1.5 milligrams per 100 litres of blood to 1.0 milligram) and the maximum punishment for gross drunken driving was increased from one to two years imprisonment. That imprisonment should be the usual punishment for gross drunken driving was stated in the preparatory work leading up to the changed legislation. At the same time a number of other changes were made in the Road Traffic Act with implications for the implementation of changed legislation on drunken driving. Firstly, the scope for the use of a pre-sentence inquiry was increased to include cases of gross drunken driving. Secondly, the law was changed concerning the offence of causing death, bodily harm or illness. Thirdly, the possibility of confiscating a vehicle in cases of gross drunken driving was made simpler. Finally, the powers of the police were increased so as to provide better possibilities for them to undertake control activities.

According to 1 § Narkotikastrafflagen of the Swedish Penal Code, it is a criminal offence to:
	•	provide narcotics
	•	produce narcotics which is meant for misuse
	•	possess narcotics with the intent to supply
	•	acquire, process, package, transport and store narcotics
	•	offer narcotics for sale
	•	possess or trade narcotics-related payments
	•	convey contact information between buyers and sellers or any other such act if the intent is to promote the trade of narcotics
	•	possess, use or handle narcotics.
Penalties are divided into four degrees. If the offence is deemed minor, the penalties range from fines to a maximum of six months in jail. The normal grade of narcotics crime may result in penalties ranging from fines to a maximum of three years in jail. If the crime is deemed as a serious narcotics offence, the penalties range from at least two years in jail to a maximum of seven years in jail. Exceptionally serious offences can result in a prison sentence of at least six years and a maximum of ten years.
There is also related legislation for mandatory health care that can possibly be used in conjunction with a sentence for a drug-related offense.

Substances which are classed as narcotics are categorized into five schedules:
	•	Schedule I: narcotics which usually do not have medicinal value
	•	Schedule II: substances which may only be brought into the country in an amount that corresponds to a maximum of five days personal consumption, which has to be justified.
	•	Schedule III: substances that are turned into morphine once in the human body 
	•	Schedule IV: sedatives such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine compounds, with the exception of flunitrazepam. Substances on this schedule may be brought into the country at most in an amount that corresponds with three weeks of personal consumption, if the patient resides permanently in Sweden. For persons who are temporarily visiting the country, a maximum supply of three months may be brought in.
	•	Schedule V: dextrometorphan as well as the sleeping agents zopiclone and zolpidem, among others. The same rules that apply to Schedule IV apply to Schedule V substances.

	▪	(1965 )- In 1965, the legal prescription of drugs began in Stockholm, after a campaign strongly supported by Expressen, the biggest newspaper in Sweden in the 1960s. Some doctors received the right to prescribe drugs, such as amphetamine and morphine, to addicts. The idea was that doctors would have the right to prescribe the drug to chronic addicts in order to reduce their propensity to commit crimes.

	▪	Eventually, police seizures showed that the drugs had become available to persons not involved in the project. 

	▪	The project ended in 1967, when a young girl was found dead from an overdose of morphine and amphetamine in the apartment of one of the participants.[17][18][19]

	▪	The Narcotic Drugs Penalty Code of (1968), including an increase of the maximum penalty for sale of illegal drugs from 2 to 6 years in prison. The law distinguish between three grades of drug offences. Section 1 was applied for offences of normal severity: illegal production, offering for sale, transfer, and possession of narcotics were punishable by fines or imprisonment for not more than two years. Section 2 was applied for petty offences; punishable by fines only, nolle prosequi was easy to receive for minor drug crimes in the 1970s. Section 3 was applied for gross offences, punishable by imprisonment for between one and four years. When determining whether the offence was gross, special attention was to be paid to whether it was committed professionally, on a large scale, involved large amounts of drugs, or whether it was especially dangerous. 

	▪	In (1969), fearing that low punishments would attract international drug traffickers, the government increased punishments for crimes involving the most gross degree, and the corresponding laws on smuggling were increased to a maximum penalty of six years.

	▪	1970 - Hemp Banned

	▪	(1969–72), was a period of temporarily increased police resources for drug law enforcement but also frequent waiving of persecution for possession of illegal substances. In 1969, about 750 police took part in a short-term, fivefold increase in the numbers of officers engaged in drug enforcement. The resources allocated to drug work steadily decreased between 1970 and 1975.[4][27]

	▪	In the beginning of the 1990s, Sweden had a financial crisis with up to 500% as the interest rate. This hurt the local economy with the cutting of tax financed social budgets. For example, the number of residential treatment places decreased by 40%. Many specialized drugs squads all over the country disappeared.[23]

	▪	On 1 January (1995), Sweden became a member of the European Union (EU). One effect of the EU's rules was reduced control of illicit drugs at the borders. The Swedish customs authority stop making random stops on the traffic and passengers who enter from EU countries; the number of employees in the Swedish customs authority is reduced by a third.[33]

	▪	In 2002, Parliament approved the National Alcohol and Drug Action Plan for the years 2002–2006.

	▪	"The objective of the Swedish drug policy should continue to be a drug-free society. The main focus of drug policy is focused and concerted efforts to limit both supply and demand of drugs…..’’

	▪	In 2005, in compliance with EU rules, cultivation of industrial hemp with less than 0.2% THC was legalized – providing the farmer followed a number of rules such as yearly registration of the field.[36]

	▪	In 2005, the Prosecutor General issued a recommendation containing more than 100 pages to prosecutors about penalties they will require for drug offenses based on previous judgments of the Supreme Court in Sweden. The report also contained a classification of hazard of more than 50 different drugs. The recommendation was expanded for a revised edition in 2009 and 2010.[37]
	▪	In 2006, Parliament approved an updated National Alcohol and Drug Action Plan for the years 2006–2010. The strategy was similar to the 2002 plan. The overall objective of the Swedish drugs policy is: a drug-free society. There are three sub-objectives:
	▪	reduce recruitment to drug abuse
	▪	induce people with substance abuse problems to give up their abuse
	▪	reduce the supply of drugs[38][39]

	▪	Between (2006 and 2013), drug-induced mortality rates in Sweden have risen steadily, with the country moving from having the ninth to the second highest rate in Europe.[10]

	▪	From 1 April 2011, the police and customs may seize synthetic drugs that are not on the list of drugs covered by the anti-drug laws if the police suspect that the purpose of the holding is related to drug abuse.

	▪	The last decade, the treatment of drug addicts with Methadone and Subutex and the number of people in the syringe exchange programs increased significantly. The number of clinics that provide treatment with Methadone or Subutex has increased from one clinic to 110 clinics. The downside of this development is much less control over who gets those drugs and how much. An increasing number of drug-related deaths can be linked to over-consumed prescribed drugs. This has led to claims that the number of doctors who can prescribe such drugs must be strictly limited to a minor number of specialist.[43]

	▪	Treatment for drug dependency in various parts of The Prison, Probation and Rehabilitation Authority (Kriminalvården') is described in The Acton plan of 2006 as a very important part of the Drug Policy of Sweden. Contract treatment instead of prison is primarily used for recurrent drug addicts where there is a clear link between a crime and the addiction. Instead of serving a prison sentence of up to two years, the convicted person signs a contract with the court to undergo a treatment programme (at an institution or at home), to partake in non-custodial care, or both. 1,439 persons were sentenced to contract treatment in 2006.[48]

	▪	Almost every municipality has its own local anti-drug coordinator to provide a broad drug preventive work directed at youths, in cooperation with politicians, police, church, educational associations and societies.[49] Sweden has a number of non-governmental anti-drug organizations as well.[1]

	▪	Sweden has among the lowest mortality rate in the world in road traffic, with 2.8 fatalities/100,000 population[64] This however doesn't affect the ones with a prescription for an illegal drug like amphetamine known as Adderall, unless stated which is the case with most dissociatives and other drugs which can seriously affect driving like opioids.

	▪	A person who has developed a drug addiction can apply to the local social welfare board in his home community to become admitted to a treatment center for drug addicts in another part of the country.

	▪	An often repeated criticism is that a decline in resources for treatment of drug addicts started in the 1990s. 
	▪	…
	▪	All these factors together end in that only a small proportion of drug abusers get more intensive treatment for their drug addiction or that treatment begins only after the abuse has become very serious.[72][73][74]

Two studies on persistent offenders in Stockholm — one on household burglars and the other on cheque forgers — showed that about half were drug injectors (Knutsson and Kuhlhorn, 1980; Persson, 1976).

Sweden saw several changes in drug legislation in the 1960s and 1970s. Swedish legislators regard the stated maximum penalty as an important declaratory signal. In 1965, with the introduction of a new Penal Code, the maximum penalty for drugs offences was reduced from two to one year's imprisonment. However, when a new Narcotic Drugs Acts was enacted in 1968, the maximum penalty for aggravated cases was increased to four years. A year later the maximum penalty was increased again, this time to six years, and only three years later, in 1972, it was increased yet again to ten years. The last two reforms were designed to harmonize Swedish legislation with international standards for drug trafficking penalties.

A period of legislative calm followed until 1981. Then the maximum penalty for aggravated offences committed by repeat offenders was increased to 16 years. In 1985 a further amendment to the legislation was designed to signal the gravity of drugs offences in general. The least serious offence category was upgraded to Petty Offence from Misdemeanor and imprisonment was added to the list of sentencing options. For more serious offences, fines were removed from the sentencing options.

Until 1988 it was illegal to produce, distribute, sell and posses drugs, but not to use drugs. In (1988) consumption became a punishable act. The offense was punishable only by fine, and this Swedish legislation severely limited the means by which the police could gather evidence of consumption. The legislation was intended to have a declaratory function, signalling the gravity of illegal drug use. This message was implicitly directed towards young people who might consider experimental use. Finally, in (1993), imprisonment was included as a sentencing option for consumption of drugs, making it possible for the police to collect evidence of use.

In the sphere of drugs, the instructions issued to prosecutors by the Prosecutor General have been very important in shaping prosecutorial — and thus police — practice. The Prosecutor General issued four Letters of Instructions between 1968 and 1972 directing prosecutors to waive prosecution for possession of drugs that were reckoned to be for personal use. The four letters progressively raised the threshold below which quantities should be regarded as for personal use. The 1971 letter included an explicit reference to "Labeling Theory," which was very influential at that time (Knutsson, 1977). It was assumed that novice or experimental users who were diverted from punishment would be spared the fate of being labeled as drug addicts, and that this would reduce the chances that they would be driven into careers as drug misusers.

During the 1970s there was a fierce and highly polarised debate over drugs policy. On the one side were those who looked upon drug addiction primarily as a social problem and favored treatment as the cure. On the other were those who favored a restrictive policy, aiming at reducing demand and availability by strict enforcement. Those favouring treatment dominated in the early 1970s. Their arguments shaped the practice of prosecutors, which in turn discouraged the police from focussing on drug dealing at street level. Towards the end of the 1970s, the second group got the upper hand. 

This is evident from instructions given to prosecutors. The Chief Prosecutor in Stockholm, where the problem was most serious, decided in 1977 that waiver of prosecution should not be used for the possession of heroin and cocaine, even for small amounts that were for personal use. Finally in 1980 the Prosecutor General reversed his position, deciding that waiver of prosecution for the possession of drugs should be the exception and not the rule. He issued an instruction that prosecution should be waived only in cases that were obviously minor, such as possession by first offenders of very small amounts. He argued that this would have the effect of decreasing availability of drugs, which would encourage drug addicts to get treatment and, crucially, would decrease the spread of illegal substances. He concluded that only actions targeting the distribution of drugs at retail level would have a significant impact on availability.

When the police were reorganised in 1965 from a local to a national system, a central drugs unit was created at the National Swedish Police Board. Previously, the main drug-related problems facing the police were burglaries of pharmacies and the forging of prescriptions. With the growth of drug misuse the National Police Board organized a countrywide operation against drug-related crime in 1969. About 750 police took part in the operation. This amounted to a short-term, fivefold increase in numbers of officers engaged in drug policing. However, probably reflecting the prevailing drug policy, the resources allocated to drug work steadily decreased between 1970 and 1975. The downward trend was reversed in 1976 when county-level drugs units were set up, with a consequent increase in manpower assigned to drug work. This marked the start of a new era with a new preventive strategy. Previously the strategy had been to reduce supply by targeting traffickers and large-scale suppliers. Consumption was defined as a treatment problem, and not a real police issue. Towards the end of the 1970s and at the start of the 1980s the police started to target retail drug markets at street level with the aim of reducing availability and demand for drugs. The change in prosecutorial policy was critical in triggering this shift. Between 1980 and 1983, several centrally planned police operations took place. The drugs units were given even more resources and drug squads were created in some of the larger police forces specifically to target street markets.

The overall growth in numbers of cases processed ultimately reflected the changes in prosecutorial practice, which had a "knock on" effect on policing.'

Public Health Agency, Sweden (2020) Comprehensive evaluation of Sweden’s 2016-2020 Alcohol, Narcotics, Doping and Tobacco Strategy. 

ANDT - strategy 2016-2020 pg. 11.

The ANDT strategy for 2016–2020 has, in addition to the overall goal, six goals and 23 focus areas. The Government states in the strategy that the goals constitute important areas that should guide the ANDT work at all levels and that the focus areas state which areas should be prioritized within the goals. The six goals are:
1. Access to alcohol, drugs, doping substances and tobacco shall be reduced.
2. The number of children and young people who start using drugs, doping substances and tobacco or debut early with alcohol will gradually decrease.
3. The number of women and men and girls and boys who develop harmful use, abuse or dependence on alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall gradually decrease.
4. Women and men as well as girls and boys with substance abuse or addiction must, based on their conditions and needs, have increased access to good quality care and support.
5. The number of women and men and girls and boys who die and are injured as a result of their own or others' use of alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall be reduced.
6. A public health-based view of ANDT within the EU and internationally.

Summary: Goal 1 pg 26
Overall, the supply of alcohol has been relatively unchanged. pg. 26
During 2010–2019, the number of Systembolaget stores per inhabitant aged 15 and older was relatively unchanged, while the number of agents for Systembolaget decreased. During 2007–2018, the number of sales outlets for folk beer per inhabitant aged 15 and over decreased. On the other hand, the number of serving places with a permanent serving permit has increased during 2007–2019 per inhabitant 15 years and older, which also applies to serving places with a permanent serving permit that are open after kl. 01:00. Real retail prices for alcohol have varied over time. Seen in the period 2011–
In 2019, the price of folk beer and wine increased slightly, while there were no significant changes in the price of strong beer and spirits. For the period 2007–2018, alcohol prices at restaurants have increased. The proportion of occasions when identification is requested when buying from Systembolaget has increased, but Systembolaget is still the most common source of alcohol for students in year 9 and upper secondary school year 2.

The supply of drugs has increased. pg 27
Street drug prices declined during 2000–2018, with the exception of marijuana, which rose in price. At the same time, the total number of seizures increased during 2000–2017. The supply of drugs is difficult to assess, but overall data indicate that the supply has increased. The increased seizure statistics are largely due to the efforts of the Police Authority and the Swedish Customs, but can also be explained by increased imports into the country.

The overall assessment for the development within goal 1 during the strategy period shows that the development for alcohol is difficult to assess as the indicators do not show a clear picture. The physical availability of alcohol (outlets) has decreased and prices at restaurants have increased. These indicators point to a decrease in supply. On the other hand, the price of alcohol at Systembolaget has decreased, which indicates an increased supply as Systembolaget accounts for 66 percent of the procurement of alcohol in the population. The development has gone in the desired direction, with a reduced availability, for tobacco. For drugs, the overall picture is difficult to assess, but there is a tendency for increased availability. With regard to the availability of doping substances, there is no basis for an assessment.

The Swedish Public Health Agency cannot assess whether or to what extent the activities have contributed to the development of access to ANDT. But we can state that even though operations have been conducted according to the strategy's priorities, the goal has not been fully achieved. This could be explained by the fact that the activities had to be conducted to a greater extent (the extent of the activities conducted is not known). It is also important to keep in mind that there is much else in society that affects ANDT development than the activities of these actors.

Summary Goal 2: excerpt from one of the 4 focus areas. pg 30

Focus area: Effective work against alcohol and tobacco trafficking
• Parents and other adults should be made more aware of their role in influencing consumption patterns and delaying the alcohol onset in adolescents.
• Counteracting longing for young people is an important effort to postpone the alcohol debut.
• Longing prevention work is closely linked to this
crime prevention. Work to reduce repair, e.g. by increasing knowledge of the consequences of
langing, has been reported. The police authority has worked with information initiatives in the form of conferences and seminars to stop the longing by making parents and other adults aware of their role in influencing young people's access to and demand for alcohol. The work has consisted of preventive information work in schools, information initiatives via Facebook, a "Think about" campaign and targeted information initiatives towards young adults, adults and parents…..

Summary: Goal 2 Development of ANDT in relation to goal 2. pg. 32
The overall assessment of the development within goal 2 during the strategy period shows a trend break for young people's use of alcohol and that the development in line with the goal has stopped. For tobacco, the development is largely positive. Tobacco smoking has decreased, but in some groups the use of snus seems to have increased. For drugs, there is a tendency for increased use during the strategy period. The development for doping is relatively unchanged.

Summary Goal 3: The number of women and men as well as girls and boys who develop harmful use, abuse or dependence on alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall gradually decrease.

Result Summary: Goal 3 pg 37
The overall assessment of the development within goal 3 during the strategy period shows a negative trend for alcohol for the adult population. Despite a decrease in total alcohol consumption, the risk consumption of alcohol appears to have increased slightly during the strategy period. For schoolchildren, intensive alcohol consumption has decreased during the strategy period. For tobacco, the overall development is in line with the goal, where smoking in the population decreases but the proportion is relatively unchanged for the use of snus. With regard to drugs, the development is not in line with the target during the same period. With regard to the development for doping, there is no basis for an overall assessment.

Goal 4: Women and men as well as girls and boys with substance abuse or addiction must, based on their conditions and needs, have increased access to good quality care and support. pg 38 start

Development in relation to the goal: pg. 42

The overall assessment for the development within goal 4 during the strategy period for the health service's efforts shows a positive development in line with the goal for the alcohol area. For the drug area, the overall picture of health care efforts is difficult to assess. The overall assessment is thus that the development is partly in line with the health service's efforts. Regarding the social services' compliance with the national guidelines on care and support in the event of abuse and dependence, comparable data are lacking for the entire strategy period, but available data show a development in line with the goal.

Swedish Crime Survery 2020 - Brå 

This summary presents the overall results of the Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) 2020. The results of the report are summarised and broken down into the following areas of inquiry: victimisation, fear of crime, confidence in the criminal justice system, and crime victims’ contact with the criminal justice system.

Of the 200,000 people included in the sample for the 2020 SCS, approximately 74,000 people participated. The method for the SCS was revised in 2017, whereby the collection procedure was changed from mainly telephone interviews to internet questionnaires and postal questionnaires. 
The selection was also expanded and some of the questions were reformulated and new questions were added. Since one main purpose of the SCS is to be able to make comparisons over time, a method has been developed to enable the results for the period 2007–2016 to be compared with 2017–2020. Every effort has been made to ensure that all the descriptions of development over time for the results described in the report are unaffected by the change in method. It is important to emphasise this as the purpose of the study is to study development over time and compare different groups in the population, rather than to estimate exact levels.

Swedish Crime Survery 2020 - Brå pg. 23 - see  Figure 15. Victimisation

	•	The 2020 SCS shows that 14.6 percent of households were victims of car theft, theft out of or from a vehicle, bicycle theft, or burglary (all referred to as property offences against households) in 2019.  
	•	The most common property offence reported for 2019 is bicycle theft (11.4%), while vehicle theft is the least common (1.0%).  
	•	The reported victimisation has increased in terms of bicycle thefts in 2019 and has been virtually unchanged in terms of theft out or from vehicles, burglary and car theft compared to 2018. The property offences that have seen the most significant development since 2006 are car-related crimes, which have decreased significantly.  
	•	A majority of those who were victims of property offences against households state that they were victims once in 2019, while a smaller percentage of the victimised households (6.7%) state that they were victims four times or more. This group suffered 30.5 percent of all property offences.

Statistical factors
Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.
Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.
In Sweden, crime statistics refer to the year when the offence was reported; the actual offence may have been committed long before. Swedish rape statistics can thus contain significant time-lag, which makes interpretations of annual changes difficult.

In 2017, British poltician Nigel Farage called Malmo the "Rape Capital of Europe." The BBC fact-checked his claim and found that Malmo, along with other urban centres in Sweden, has one of the highest levels of reported rapes in proportion to population in the EU, but that this is mainly due to the strictness of Swedish rape laws and how rape is recorded in the country. The BBC noted that the rate of reported rapes in Malmo had not dramatically risen in recent years and had declined from a peak in 2010, before large-scale refugee arrivals to the city. (Note: Interesting that he (Nigel Farage) points the finger at Sweden, when in fact England/Wales had the largest increase in rape cases over the period 2013-2017, with an increase of 2.5 times. it was likely a political attempt to coerce citizens to vote for Brexit.)

Birthplace of perpetrators
In 2018, Swedish Television investigative journalism show Uppdrag Granskning analysed the total of 843 district court cases from the five preceding years and found that 58% of all convicted of rape and attempted rape had a foreign background (Southern Africans, Northern Africans, Arabs, Middle Easterns, and Afghans) and 40% were immigrants born in the Middle East and Africa, with young men from Afghanistan numbering 45 stood out as being the next most common country of birth after Sweden. When only analysing rape assault (Swedish: överfallsvåldtäkt) cases, that is cases where perpetrator and victim were not previously acquainted, 97 out of 129 were born outside Europe. 

The Mission Investigation programme, broadcast by SVT, said that the total number of offenders over five years was 843. Of those, 197 were from the Middle East and North Africa, with 45 coming from Afghanistan, and 134 from Southern Africa.[26] "We are very clear in the programme that it is a small percentage of the people coming from abroad who are convicted of rape," chief editor Ulf Johansson told the BBC News. Former policeman Mustafa Panshiri said that Afghan immigrants bring with them attitudes towards women and sexuality which collide with Swedish values concerning equality.[26][22] Swedish Television's investigating journalists found that in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born sex offenders was more than 80%.

Legal factors
The way the crime itself is defined and various related aspects of the judicial process affect the registration of offences in the official statistics.[13][14] The concept of rape can be defined narrowly or in a more expansive manner. In Sweden, the definition of rape has been successively widened over the years, leading to an ever-larger number of sexual assaults being classified as rape.[3][27][28][29] For example, in (1992) a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape. This legislative change resulted in about a 25% increase in the level of registered rape offences.[13]
Changes in the legal process has also affected the number of reports. Until (1984), rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges, with an additional restriction of a six months time limit. This resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going unreported.[13]

SOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden


von Hofer (2000) investigated the causes of differences in levels in report statistics betweencountries, with a focus on rape. He divided the factors that affect the statistics into three categories: statistical, legal and substantive. Statistical factors relate to the step in the judicial chain at which a reported crime is registered in the statistics and how the number of crimes is counted, such as whether repeat offences of the same type involving the same victim and perpetrator are counted one or more times in the statistics. Legal factors encompass, for example, how rape legislation is worded. This may concern how the sexual assault of children is classified or which sexual acts are considered rape. The statistics are also affected by different legal process factors. By substantive factors, von Hofer means the extent of the “actual” crime, as well as the general propensity to report crimes and the extent to which the criminal justice system addresses and registers these reports. According to von Hofer, the statistical, legal and substantive factors contribute to the level of reported rapes in Sweden becoming inflated in relation to the European average. As such, he asserts that crime statistics are largely a social construct and not a “true” picture of reality. However, according to the author, one cannot rule out the possibility that more rapes are actually committed in Sweden than in, for example, countries where women are subject to stricter social control.

In a previous report (1999), Brå has attempted to estimate the effect of differences in the point at which crimes are registered and the manner in which they are counted. The analysis included a number of different types of crime, including rapes reported in 1997. 
Time of reporting: If the statistics had been prepared after the investigations were completed, rather than at the time the reports were made, the number of rapes reported to the police would have fallen by 16 percent. 
Classification (definition): If only the most serious crime in a report was counted in the statistics (the principal offence approach), the number of reported rapes in the statistics would have fallen by eight percent. 
Numeration: If serial crimes had been counted once instead of several times, the reported rape statistics would have fallen by 14 percent.
Recording alignment: If Sweden had recorded its statistics in the same manner as those countries which are restrictive in all the aspects listed above, the number of reported rapes in the statistics would have fallen by 29 percent.

Figure 4 presents statistics from Eurostat on the average number of reported rapes per 100,000 inhabitants and year for the period 2013–2017.7 It is apparent that the countries with the most reports are Sweden and England/Wales. Generally speaking, a pattern can be discerned with more reported rapes per capita in north-western Europe than in southern and eastern Europe.

Several different legal factors affect the report statistics in Eurostat. First, there are factors associated with the legal definition of rape. This mainly concerns three aspects which can differ, namely: • Whether force must be involved for an act to be classified as rape • Which sexual acts are included in the definition of rape • Who can rape and who can be raped

When the Swedish criminal code came into force in (1965), rape was described as follows: If a man forces a woman to have sexual intercourse through violence or threats entailing imminent danger, he is guilty of rape and is sentenced to imprisonment, for at least two and at most ten years. Rendering a woman powerless or putting her in a similar state is to be equated with violence.

Since then, the Swedish legislation on rape has been amended on six occasions. 

The definition can also change over time in the different countries, and considerable amendments have been made to the rape legislation in individual countries in recent years. Both Sweden and Denmark broadened their rape legislation in (2013,) Norway made some amendments in 2015 (including in the classification of child abuse), and Germany introduced consentbased legislation in 2016, as did Sweden in July 2018. 

Since 1 July 2018, the rape definition is based on consent: A person who performs sexual intercourse, or some other sexual act that in view of the seriousness of the violation is comparable to sexual intercourse, with a person who is not participating voluntarily is guilty of rape and is sentenced to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years11.

Sexual activity with minors was illegal in all countries – but the offence is not always included in the rape statistics

There are other legal factors which affect the report statistics. These do not concern the wording of legal paragraphs on rape, but rather how the criminal justice system processes the reports that are made. These include, for example: • How crimes committed abroad are processed by the criminal justice system • Whether the police must register all crimes brought to their attention.

Sweden’s model is based on the principle of legality, which means that under the Swedish Police Act the police are obligated to file a report in the event of the suspicion of an offence subject to public prosecution, which includes rape. 

	•	Are attempted crimes included in the rape statistics submitted to Eurostat? 
	•	Is the basis for the statistics compiled from the information available when the crimes were reported or once the investigations were completed? 
	•	Which unit of analysis are the statistics based on: individual offences, reports or victims? 
	•	If a report includes different types of offence committed on the same occasion, are all the offences counted? 
	•	If a report includes repeated offences of the same type, are all the offences counted? 
	•	If a report includes an offence committed by several perpetrators, are all the perpetrators counted?

The police in Sweden are obliged to file a report, even if the incident is obviously made up at the time of the complaint. In other words, the statistics also encompass such reports, as well as cases where once the reported incident has been investigated, the case is closed since no offence has been committed.

Figure 6. Factors in the European countries’ legislation and statistical methods that influence the number of rapes reported to the police. Source: Eurostat and EIGE. 1. Is marital rape criminalised? 2. Is sexual activity with a minor classified as rape? 3. Can men be raped? 4. Does the definition of rape include acts other than sexual intercourse? 5. Does the definition of rape include acts that do not involve violence/threats? 6. Are the statistics based on the influx of reports? 7. Do the statistics use offence (rather than victim/case) as the unit of analysis? 8. Are serial crimes counted several times? 9. Are multiple offences counted several times (as opposed to the principal offenceapproach)?  Yes to all: Sweden, Belgium, Denmark. Yes to all but one: Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg. 

The primary purpose of the report statistics is not to illustrate the extent of crime. Their primary purpose is to describe how many reports the police process. But how can we measure the real level of crime in a society? Most criminologists agree that we will never be able to say exactly how many crimes are committed (see, for example, Skogan, 1975). No single source of knowledge contains enough information. So, to draw the most reliable conclusions as possible about the level of crime, we ought to combine different sources (Brå, 2012). Aside from criminal statistics, this can mean healthcare data (Brå, 2017), statistics from insurance companies and surveys into individuals’ participation in and exposure to crime.

Denna utredning levererades i mars 2018, men Akademien var då inte ense om vilka åtgärder utredningsresultatet borde leda till.

Assault/Murder:Rows: murder, assault, Column: year
Look at historical cases of serial killers, could this spawn other cases internationally? Are there sharp increases which could be explained by gang reports (check Polismyndigheten).




Other: Rows: fraud, criminal_damage, Column: year
Look at historical fraud, Watergate, Enron, World Financial Crisis (non fraud, but almost). Are there any cases in Sweden which are particularly relevant?

Convictions: 
	•	Statistics relating to persons convicted for criminal offences present those found guilty either by court (county court convictions) or by prosecutors (through prosecutor fines or waivers of prosecution).
	•	In 2020, there were approximately 109,000 so-called conviction decisions laid down by the courts or the prosecutors. This is a 5 percent increase compared to 2019.
	•	Since 1975, the number of convictions has decreased by 65 percent. The greatest reduction came at the end of the 1970s in connection with the decriminalization of public drunkenness. Since then the trend has been more stable, but there has nonetheless been a continuous reduction in number of convictions. In part the reduction can be explained by the fact that over time the police have received extended authority to issue summary fines for a larger number of petty offences. These are presented separately in the conviction statistics. Part of the decrease, particularly between the years 1994—1996, can also be explained if viewed in relation to the fact that the number of cleared offences also fell during this period of time.
	•	Road traffic offences constitute the most common offence type for which someone is convicted. In 2020, offences against various road traffic statutes were the principal offence in 30 percent of all convictions. The second most common offence type is crimes against the Narcotics Drugs Act, which was the principal offence in 27 percent of the convictions in 2020.
Fines most common sanction
	•	Fines issued either by the courts or the prosecutor is the most common form of sanction. In 2020, 60 percent of all convictions carried fines as the principal sanction. In addition, 242,000 summary fines were issued directly by the police.
	•	In 2020, about 10 percent (11,200) of all convictions carried a prison sentence. The most common sentence length was of a maximum of two months (41 percent of all convictions carrying a prison sentence) while the second most common sentence length was of over two months but no more than six months (21 percent of all convictions carrying a prison sentence). About 1,640 sentences or 14 percent of the prison sentence carried a prison term of over two years, 20 of which carried a life sentence. In 2020, 65 youths were sentenced to youth custody, a sanction that since 1999 has largely replaced the use of prison for youths up to eighteen years of age.
	•	A legislative change introduced 1 January 2007 led to the sanctions youth care and youth service, previously included under care of the social services, now having become separate sanctions. There were about 3,250 youth care and youth service sentences in 2020.
	•	In 2020, there were 9,650 convictions that carried a suspended sentence as the principal sanction, of which 32 percent (3,130 convictions) were combined with community service.
	•	Men and women accounted for 83 and 17 percent respectively of those found guilty of offences in 2020. Youths aged between fifteen and twenty made up approximately 20 percent of all convicted in 2020. In relation to the proportion of the population, youths are over-represented among those found guilty of offences compared to members of other age groups.
