\cf0 I was motivated by the Securitas internship interview where I learned that they are interested in delivering crime statistics to individuals to help inform them on safety and on options for security, and for businesses/corporations to help them to set liability and security indices for insurance adjustments etc. given the implemented security procedures that Securitas offers.\
\
With a broad overview of the crime statistics in Sweden, it might be interesting to see trends and to show where one can further develop questions on how to gain insights through data which exists or which is missing.\

Note: No data set that I saw was really digging deep into the information. It is clear that they did not read the statistics report from SCB. Data was from 1950 to 2015. Also, it is not clear where the population data comes from in this csv as it does not match with that found in SCB database.\

The official figures in Sweden do not reflect the reality particularly well either. Autopsies are performed on almost 90 % of drivers who die in road accidents, during which samples of body fluids are taken and then sent for analysis to the National Board of Forensic Medicine. When the data on fatal accidents is correlated with the results of the analyses, the finding is that 19 % of Swedish drivers who died in accidents in 1999 had alcohol in their bodies. The official statistics for that year put the figure at 5,6 %! The reality, therefore, is three times the figure given in the official statistics. We must also understand that not even that 19 % is a true reflection of reality since some of those casualties survived the accident for a time, during which any alcohol may have dissipated.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li300\ri700\sl240\sa200\partightenfactor0
\cf8 One reason for the faulty statistics in Sweden is that the official accident figures are based on police accident reports. The possible influence of alcohol as a factor in the accident is based on police suspicion that there was. In an accident, the police's main task is to prevent injury to anyone else and priority is therefore given to the other traffic, which means that they very frequently fail to test the driver's alcohol level.\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf8 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
The most recent changes in the Swedish legislation on driving whilst under the influence of alcohol entered into force on 1 February 1994. Therewith, the limit for the blood alcohol content (BAC) was reduced from 1.5 per mill to 1.0 per mill (i.e. from 1.5 milligrams per 100 litres of blood to 1.0 milligram) and the maximum punishment for gross drunken driving was increased from one to two years imprisonment. That imprisonment should be the usual punishment for gross drunken driving was stated in the preparatory work leading up to the changed legislation. At the same time a number of other changes were made in the Road Traffic Act with implications for the implementation of changed legislation on drunken driving. Firstly, the scope for the use of a pre-sentence inquiry was increased to include cases of gross drunken driving. Secondly, the law was changed concerning the offence of causing death, bodily harm or illness. Thirdly, the possibility of confiscating a vehicle in cases of gross drunken driving was made simpler. Finally, the powers of the police were increased so as to provide better possibilities for them to undertake control activities.\

Two studies on persistent offenders in Stockholm \'97 one on household burglars and the other on cheque forgers \'97 showed that about half were drug injectors (Knutsson and Kuhlhorn, 1980; Persson, 1976).\
\
Sweden saw several changes in drug legislation in the 1960s and 1970s. Swedish legislators regard the stated maximum penalty as an important declaratory signal. In 1965, with the introduction of a new Penal Code, the maximum penalty for drugs offences was reduced from two to one year's imprisonment. However, when a new Narcotic Drugs Acts was enacted in 1968, the maximum penalty for aggravated cases was increased to four years. A year later the maximum penalty was increased again, this time to six years, and only three years later, in 1972, it was increased yet again to ten years. The last two reforms were designed to harmonize Swedish legislation with international standards for drug trafficking penalties.\
\
A period of legislative calm followed until 1981. Then the maximum penalty for aggravated offences committed by repeat offenders was increased to 16 years. In 1985 a further amendment to the legislation was designed to signal the gravity of drugs offences in general. The least serious offence category was upgraded to Petty Offence from Misdemeanor and imprisonment was added to the list of sentencing options. For more serious offences, fines were removed from the sentencing options.\
\
Until 1988 it was illegal to produce, distribute, sell and posses drugs, but not to use drugs. In (1988) consumption became a punishable act. The offense was punishable only by fine, and this Swedish legislation severely limited the means by which the police could gather evidence of consumption. The legislation was intended to have a declaratory function, signalling the gravity of illegal drug use. This message was implicitly directed towards young people who might consider experimental use. Finally, in (1993), imprisonment was included as a sentencing option for consumption of drugs, making it possible for the police to collect evidence of use.\
\
In the sphere of drugs, the instructions issued to prosecutors by the Prosecutor General have been very important in shaping prosecutorial \'97 and thus police \'97 practice. The Prosecutor General issued four Letters of Instructions between 1968 and 1972 directing prosecutors to waive prosecution for possession of drugs that were reckoned to be for personal use. The four letters progressively raised the threshold below which quantities should be regarded as for personal use. The 1971 letter included an explicit reference to "Labeling Theory," which was very influential at that time (Knutsson, 1977). It was assumed that novice or experimental users who were diverted from punishment would be spared the fate of being labeled as drug addicts, and that this would reduce the chances that they would be driven into careers as drug misusers.\
\
During the 1970s there was a fierce and highly polarised debate over drugs policy. On the one side were those who looked upon drug addiction primarily as a social problem and favored treatment as the cure. On the other were those who favored a restrictive policy, aiming at reducing demand and availability by strict enforcement. Those favouring treatment dominated in the early 1970s. Their arguments shaped the practice of prosecutors, which in turn discouraged the police from focussing on drug dealing at street level. Towards the end of the 1970s, the second group got the upper hand. \
\
This is evident from instructions given to prosecutors. The Chief Prosecutor in Stockholm, where the problem was most serious, decided in 1977 that waiver of prosecution should not be used for the possession of heroin and cocaine, even for small amounts that were for personal use. Finally in 1980 the Prosecutor General reversed his position, deciding that waiver of prosecution for the possession of drugs should be the exception and not the rule. He issued an instruction that prosecution should be waived only in cases that were obviously minor, such as possession by first offenders of very small amounts. He argued that this would have the effect of decreasing availability of drugs, which would encourage drug addicts to get treatment and, crucially, would decrease the spread of illegal substances. He concluded that only actions targeting the distribution of drugs at retail level would have a significant impact on availability.\
\
When the police were reorganised in 1965 from a local to a national system, a central drugs unit was created at the National Swedish Police Board. Previously, the main drug-related problems facing the police were burglaries of pharmacies and the forging of prescriptions. With the growth of drug misuse the National Police Board organized a countrywide operation against drug-related crime in 1969. About 750 police took part in the operation. This amounted to a short-term, fivefold increase in numbers of officers engaged in drug policing. However, probably reflecting the prevailing drug policy, the resources allocated to drug work steadily decreased between 1970 and 1975. The downward trend was reversed in 1976 when county-level drugs units were set up, with a consequent increase in manpower assigned to drug work. This marked the start of a new era with a new preventive strategy. Previously the strategy had been to reduce supply by targeting traffickers and large-scale suppliers. Consumption was defined as a treatment problem, and not a real police issue. Towards the end of the 1970s and at the start of the 1980s the police started to target retail drug markets at street level with the aim of reducing availability and demand for drugs. The change in prosecutorial policy was critical in triggering this shift. Between 1980 and 1983, several centrally planned police operations took place. The drugs units were given even more resources and drug squads were created in some of the larger police forces specifically to target street markets.\
\
The overall growth in numbers of cases processed ultimately reflected the changes in prosecutorial practice, which had a "knock on" effect on policing.'\

Public Health Agency, Sweden (2020) Comprehensive evaluation of Sweden\'92s 2016-2020 Alcohol, Narcotics, Doping and Tobacco Strategy. \
\
ANDT - strategy 2016-2020 pg. 11.\
\
The ANDT strategy for 2016\'962020 has, in addition to the overall goal, six goals and 23 focus areas. The Government states in the strategy that the goals constitute important areas that should guide the ANDT work at all levels and that the focus areas state which areas should be prioritized within the goals. The six goals are:\
1. Access to alcohol, drugs, doping substances and tobacco shall be reduced.\
2. The number of children and young people who start using drugs, doping substances and tobacco or debut early with alcohol will gradually decrease.\
3. The number of women and men and girls and boys who develop harmful use, abuse or dependence on alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall gradually decrease.\
4. Women and men as well as girls and boys with substance abuse or addiction must, based on their conditions and needs, have increased access to good quality care and support.\
5. The number of women and men and girls and boys who die and are injured as a result of their own or others' use of alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall be reduced.\
6. A public health-based view of ANDT within the EU and internationally.\
\
Summary: Goal 1 pg 26\
Overall, the supply of alcohol has been relatively unchanged. pg. 26\
During 2010\'962019, the number of Systembolaget stores per inhabitant aged 15 and older was relatively unchanged, while the number of agents for Systembolaget decreased. During 2007\'962018, the number of sales outlets for folk beer per inhabitant aged 15 and over decreased. On the other hand, the number of serving places with a permanent serving permit has increased during 2007\'962019 per inhabitant 15 years and older, which also applies to serving places with a permanent serving permit that are open after kl. 01:00. Real retail prices for alcohol have varied over time. Seen in the period 2011\'96\
In 2019, the price of folk beer and wine increased slightly, while there were no significant changes in the price of strong beer and spirits. For the period 2007\'962018, alcohol prices at restaurants have increased. The proportion of occasions when identification is requested when buying from Systembolaget has increased, but Systembolaget is still the most common source of alcohol for students in year 9 and upper secondary school year 2.\
\
The supply of drugs has increased. pg 27\
Street drug prices declined during 2000\'962018, with the exception of marijuana, which rose in price. At the same time, the total number of seizures increased during 2000\'962017. The supply of drugs is difficult to assess, but overall data indicate that the supply has increased. The increased seizure statistics are largely due to the efforts of the Police Authority and the Swedish Customs, but can also be explained by increased imports into the country.\
\
The overall assessment for the development within goal 1 during the strategy period shows that the development for alcohol is difficult to assess as the indicators do not show a clear picture. The physical availability of alcohol (outlets) has decreased and prices at restaurants have increased. These indicators point to a decrease in supply. On the other hand, the price of alcohol at Systembolaget has decreased, which indicates an increased supply as Systembolaget accounts for 66 percent of the procurement of alcohol in the population. The development has gone in the desired direction, with a reduced availability, for tobacco. For drugs, the overall picture is difficult to assess, but there is a tendency for increased availability. With regard to the availability of doping substances, there is no basis for an assessment.\
\
The Swedish Public Health Agency cannot assess whether or to what extent the activities have contributed to the development of access to ANDT. But we can state that even though operations have been conducted according to the strategy's priorities, the goal has not been fully achieved. This could be explained by the fact that the activities had to be conducted to a greater extent (the extent of the activities conducted is not known). It is also important to keep in mind that there is much else in society that affects ANDT development than the activities of these actors.\
\
Summary Goal 2: excerpt from one of the 4 focus areas. pg 30\
\
Focus area: Effective work against alcohol and tobacco trafficking\
\'95 Parents and other adults should be made more aware of their role in influencing consumption patterns and delaying the alcohol onset in adolescents.\
\'95 Counteracting longing for young people is an important effort to postpone the alcohol debut.\
\'95 Longing prevention work is closely linked to this\
crime prevention. Work to reduce repair, e.g. by increasing knowledge of the consequences of\
langing, has been reported. The police authority has worked with information initiatives in the form of conferences and seminars to stop the longing by making parents and other adults aware of their role in influencing young people's access to and demand for alcohol. The work has consisted of preventive information work in schools, information initiatives via Facebook, a "Think about" campaign and targeted information initiatives towards young adults, adults and parents\'85..\
\
Summary: Goal 2 Development of ANDT in relation to goal 2. pg. 32\
The overall assessment of the development within goal 2 during the strategy period shows a trend break for young people's use of alcohol and that the development in line with the goal has stopped. For tobacco, the development is largely positive. Tobacco smoking has decreased, but in some groups the use of snus seems to have increased. For drugs, there is a tendency for increased use during the strategy period. The development for doping is relatively unchanged.\
\
Summary Goal 3: The number of women and men as well as girls and boys who develop harmful use, abuse or dependence on alcohol, drugs, doping substances or tobacco shall gradually decrease.\
\
Result Summary: Goal 3 pg 37\
The overall assessment of the development within goal 3 during the strategy period shows a negative trend for alcohol for the adult population. Despite a decrease in total alcohol consumption, the risk consumption of alcohol appears to have increased slightly during the strategy period. For schoolchildren, intensive alcohol consumption has decreased during the strategy period. For tobacco, the overall development is in line with the goal, where smoking in the population decreases but the proportion is relatively unchanged for the use of snus. With regard to drugs, the development is not in line with the target during the same period. With regard to the development for doping, there is no basis for an overall assessment.\
\
Goal 4: Women and men as well as girls and boys with substance abuse or addiction must, based on their conditions and needs, have increased access to good quality care and support. pg 38 start\
\
Development in relation to the goal: pg. 42\
\
The overall assessment for the development within goal 4 during the strategy period for the health service's efforts shows a positive development in line with the goal for the alcohol area. For the drug area, the overall picture of health care efforts is difficult to assess. The overall assessment is thus that the development is partly in line with the health service's efforts. Regarding the social services' compliance with the national guidelines on care and support in the event of abuse and dependence, comparable data are lacking for the entire strategy period, but available data show a development in line with the goal.\

This summary presents the overall results of the Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) 2020. The results of the report are summarised and broken down into the following areas of inquiry: victimisation, fear of crime, confidence in the criminal justice system, and crime victims\'92 contact with the criminal justice system.\
\
Of the 200,000 people included in the sample for the 2020 SCS, approximately 74,000 people participated. The method for the SCS was revised in 2017, whereby the collection procedure was changed from mainly telephone interviews to internet questionnaires and postal questionnaires.\uc0\u8232 \
The selection was also expanded and some of the questions were reformulated and new questions were added. Since one main purpose of the SCS is to be able to make comparisons over time, a method has been developed to enable the results for the period 2007\'962016 to be compared with 2017\'962020. Every effort has been made to ensure that all the descriptions of development over time for the results described in the report are unaffected by the change in method. It is important to emphasise this as the purpose of the study is to study development over time and compare different groups in the population, rather than to estimate exact levels.\

\f5\b0\fs28 \cf23 Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.\
Sweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.\
In Sweden, crime statistics refer to the year when the offence was reported; the actual offence may have been committed long before. Swedish rape statistics can thus contain significant time-lag, which makes interpretations of annual changes difficult.

The BBC noted that the rate of reported rapes in Malmo had not dramatically risen in recent years and had declined from a peak in 2010, before large-scale refugee arrivals to the city. 
\f6\i (Note: Interesting that he (Nigel Farage) points the finger at Sweden, when in fact England/Wales had the largest increase in rape cases over the period 2013-2017, with an increase of 2.5 times. it was likely a political attempt to coerce citizens to vote for Brexit.)

von Hofer (2000) investigated the causes of differences in levels in report statistics betweencountries, with a focus on rape. He divided the factors that affect the statistics into three categories: statistical, legal and substantive. Statistical factors relate to the step in the judicial chain at which a reported crime is registered in the statistics and how the number of crimes is counted, such as whether repeat offences of the same type involving the same victim and perpetrator are counted one or more times in the statistics. Legal factors encompass, for example, how rape legislation is worded. This may concern how the sexual assault of children is classified or which sexual acts are considered rape. The statistics are also affected by different legal process factors. By substantive factors, von Hofer means the extent of the \'93actual\'94 crime, as well as the general propensity to report crimes and the extent to which the criminal justice system addresses and registers these reports. According to von Hofer, the statistical, legal and substantive factors contribute to the level of reported rapes in Sweden becoming inflated in relation to the European average. As such, he asserts that crime statistics are largely a social construct and not a \'93true\'94 picture of reality. However, according to the author, one cannot rule out the possibility that more rapes are actually committed in Sweden than in, for example, countries where women are subject to stricter social control.\
\
In a previous report (1999), Br\'e5 has attempted to estimate the effect of differences in the point at which crimes are registered and the manner in which they are counted. The analysis included a number of different types of crime, including rapes reported in 1997. \

\f9\b Time of reporting
\f4\b0 : If the statistics had been prepared after the investigations were completed, rather than at the time the reports were made, the number of rapes reported to the police would have fallen by 16 percent. \

\f9\b Classification (definition)
\f4\b0 : If only the most serious crime in a report was counted in the statistics (the principal offence approach), the number of reported rapes in the statistics would have fallen by eight percent. \

\f9\b Numeration
\f4\b0 : If serial crimes had been counted once instead of several times, the reported rape statistics would have fallen by 14 percent.\

\f9\b Recording alignment
\f4\b0 : If Sweden had recorded its statistics in the same manner as those countries which are restrictive in all the aspects listed above, the number of reported rapes in the statistics would have fallen by 29 percent.\
\
Figure 4 presents statistics from Eurostat on the average number of reported rapes per 100,000 inhabitants and year for the period 2013\'962017.7 It is apparent that the countries with the most reports are Sweden and England/Wales. Generally speaking, a pattern can be discerned with more reported rapes per capita in north-western Europe than in southern and eastern Europe.\
\
Several different legal factors affect the report statistics in Eurostat. First, there are factors associated with the legal definition of rape. This mainly concerns three aspects which can differ, namely: \'95 Whether force must be involved for an act to be classified as rape \'95 Which sexual acts are included in the definition of rape \'95 Who can rape and who can be raped\
\
When the Swedish criminal code came into force in (1965), rape was described as follows: If a man forces a woman to have sexual intercourse through violence or threats entailing imminent danger, he is guilty of rape and is sentenced to imprisonment, for at least two and at most ten years. Rendering a woman powerless or putting her in a similar state is to be equated with violence.\
\
Since then, the Swedish legislation on rape has been amended on six occasions. \
\
The definition can also change over time in the different countries, and considerable amendments have been made to the rape legislation in individual countries in recent years. Both Sweden and Denmark broadened their rape legislation in (2013,) Norway made some amendments in 2015 (including in the classification of child abuse), and Germany introduced consentbased legislation in 2016, as did Sweden in July 2018. \
\
Since 1 July 2018, the rape definition is based on consent: A person who performs sexual intercourse, or some other sexual act that in view of the seriousness of the violation is comparable to sexual intercourse, with a person who is not participating voluntarily is guilty of rape and is sentenced to imprisonment for at least two and at most six years11.\
\
Sexual activity with minors was illegal in all countries \'96 but the offence is not always included in the rape statistics\
\
There are other legal factors which affect the report statistics. These do not concern the wording of legal paragraphs on rape, but rather how the criminal justice system processes the reports that are made. These include, for example: \'95 How crimes committed abroad are processed by the criminal justice system \'95 Whether the police must register all crimes brought to their attention.\
\
Sweden\'92s model is based on the principle of legality, which means that under the Swedish Police Act the police are obligated to file a report in the event of the suspicion of an offence subject to public prosecution, which includes rape. \

The police in Sweden are obliged to file a report, even if the incident is obviously made up at the time of the complaint. In other words, the statistics also encompass such reports, as well as cases where once the reported incident has been investigated, the case is closed since no offence has been committed.\

Does the definition of rape include acts that do not involve violence/threats? 6. Are the statistics based on the influx of reports? 7. Do the statistics use offence (rather than victim/case) as the unit of analysis? 8. Are serial crimes counted several times? 9. Are multiple offences counted several times (as opposed to the principal offenceapproach)?  Yes to all: Sweden, Belgium, Denmark. Yes to all but one: Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg. \
\
The primary purpose of the report statistics is not to illustrate the extent of crime. Their primary purpose is to describe how many reports the police process. But how can we measure the real level of crime in a society? Most criminologists agree that we will never be able to say exactly how many crimes are committed (see, for example, Skogan, 1975). No single source of knowledge contains enough information. So, to draw the most reliable conclusions as possible about the level of crime, we ought to combine different sources (Br\'e5, 2012). Aside from criminal statistics, this can mean healthcare data (Br\'e5, 2017), statistics from insurance companies and surveys into individuals\'92 participation in and exposure to crime.\

Since 1975, the number of convictions has decreased by 65 percent. The greatest reduction came at the end of the 1970s in connection with the decriminalization of public drunkenness. Since then the trend has been more stable, but there has nonetheless been a continuous reduction in number of convictions. In part the reduction can be explained by the fact that over time the police have received extended authority to issue summary fines for a larger number of petty offences. These are presented separately in the conviction statistics. Part of the decrease, particularly between the years 1994\'971996, can also be explained if viewed in relation to the fact that the number of cleared offences also fell during this period of time.\
